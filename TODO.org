This is list a of rough ideas.  Feel free to contribute your own, ask/answer
questions and point out issues.

* commands

** TODO Allow selecting multiple torrents for action
   The user should be able to mark and unmark torrents with space.
     - Add a new column that displays a single character if the torrent is
       selected.
     - Make command 'select' which takes one argument: 'add'/'+',
       'remove'/'-', 'all'/'*' or 'none'/'0'.  Executing the command does what
       the argument says to the focused torrent (in case of 'add'/'remove') or
       adds/removes all torrents in the current list to the selection (in case
       of 'none'/'0').  It should also accept a FILTER argument.

*** TODO Show number of selected torrents
    The best place would probably in the bottom bar.  Either implement that in
    tui.infobar.TorrentCountersWidget or create a new widget.

*** TODO All torrent commands should use torrent selection
    Commands like stop, start, verify, etc should apply to
      - all marked torrents if any torrents are marked.
      - the focused torrent if any torrent is focused.
      - the torrents selected by FILTER argument(s).
    Use the 'make_selection' mixin in commands/base/(cli|tui)/mixin.py.

** TODO New command: unbind
   Remove previously defined keybinding

** TODO New command: sort
   Sort torrents or peers in the focused list.  Check if tab actually contains
   a sortable list and not something like a help page.

** TODO New command: interactive
   Take an arbitrary amount of (option, prompt) pairs and any command.  The
   command contains placeholders.  First, for each (option, prompt) pair, the
   user has to supply a value.  Each placeholder is then replaced with its
   value and the command is executed if all placeholders are filled.

   Example: interactive dest:Destination -- mv {dest}

   This is mostly useful for better keybindings in the TUI, but it may also
   have benefits on the CLI.

** TODO add: --path,-p option
   The newly added torrent is downloaded to the specified path.


* torrent list

** TODO Add tracker column
   Use the domain without the TLD part.

** TODO Add status column


* client

** TODO NotImplementedError
   The classes exported by `client` should derive from base classes that raise
   NotImplementedError in all undefined methods and properties.

*** TODO NotImplementedError callbacks
    Figure out how to avoid tons of ~try: ... except NotImplementedError as e:
    log.error(e)~.  Maybe with a callback somewhere?


* tui.logger

** TODO Make log widget scrollable
   How to scroll?  Do we need a command for that, like ~scrollog
   up/down/pgup/pgdown~?  Is there a better way?


* tui.tabs

** TODO New tab not always rendered
   If no tab exists and a new one is created, it isn't rendered until
   something else happens, like opening the command prompt.
