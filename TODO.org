This is list a of rough ideas.  Feel free to contribute your own, ask/answer
questions and point out issues.

* commands
** TODO tab: Add --background,-b option                         :improvement:
   If given, the new or specified tab should not be focused.

** TODO New command: sort                                       :improvement:
   Sort torrents in the focused list or in another tab (--focus,-f).  Check if
   tab actually contains a torrent list and not a help page, for example.

** TODO New command: columns                                    :improvement:
   Set the columns in the focused list or in another tab (--focus,-f).  Check
   if tab actually contains a torrent list and not a help page, for example.

** TODO add: --path,-p option                                   :improvement:
   The newly added torrent is downloaded to the specified path.

** TODO Command chaining with &, |, ;                           :improvement:
   Commands can be separated with '&', '|' or ';'.  Run each command
   separately.  Stop execution if:
    - The previous command failed and is separated with '&'
    - The previous command succeeeded and is separated with '|'

*** TODO Document how command chaining works in 'help commands'

*** TODO Maybe offer alternatives to '&', '|', and ';'?
    Ideally, the command chaining characters should be escapable, which is
    straightforward in the built-in prompt.  But on the CLI they have meaning
    to the shell, which means they have to be escaped twice, once so the shell
    ignores them and then again for stig to ignore them.

    Maybe offer '+', '-' and ':' as aliases? The downside would be that there
    are more characters one would have to escape in torrent names, etc.


* client
** TODO NotImplementedError                                     :improvement:
   The classes exported by `client` should derive from base classes that raise
   NotImplementedError in all undefined methods and properties.

*** TODO NotImplementedError callbacks
    Figure out how to avoid tons of ~try: ... except NotImplementedError as e:
    log.error(e)~.  Maybe with a callback somewhere?


** TODO Allow selecting multiple torrents for action
   The user should be able to mark and unmark torrents with space.
     - Add a new column that displays a single character if the torrent is
       selected.
     - Make command 'select' which takes one argument: 'add'/'+',
       'remove'/'-', 'all'/'*' or 'none'/'0'.  Executing the command does what
       the argument says to the focused torrent (in case of 'add'/'remove') or
       adds/removes all torrents in the current list to the selection (in case
       of 'none'/'0').  It should also accept a FILTER argument.

*** TODO Show number of selected torrents
    The best place would probably in the bottom bar.  Either implement that in
    tui.infobar.TorrentCountersWidget or create a new widget.

*** TODO All torrent commands should use torrent selection
    Commands like stop, start, verify, etc should apply to
      - all marked torrents if any torrents are marked.
      - the focused torrent if any torrent is focused.
      - the torrents selected by FILTER argument(s).
    Use the 'make_selection' mixin in commands/base/(cli|tui)/mixin.py.


* tui.logger
** TODO Some long log messages are not displayed                        :bug:
   To reproduce, create some log messages and change the terminal size.

   ~$ stig --debug client.aiotransmission~

   Some messages will appear as empty but show the message when the terminal
   becomes large enough.

** TODO Make log widget scrollable                              :improvement:
   How to scroll?  Do we need a command for that, like ~scrollog
   up/down/pgup/pgdown~?  Is there a better way?


* tui.tabs
** TODO New tab not always rendered                                     :bug:
   If no tab exists and a new one is created, it isn't rendered until
   something else happens, like opening the command prompt.
